# IbayUserCrawler
another case of why you should not have a numebr based ID for indexing webpages

a simple crawler to go through ibay users one by one and log their username and url to a .csv file

i removed the code where i collect other details cause i do not want to provide full on
scrapping tools. if you would like to feel free to add the features the base code is there.
